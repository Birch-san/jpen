We are currently migrating development from [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpen/) to GitHub:

* The new **code repository** is [here](https://github.com/nicarran/jpen) and contains the history of the previous [svn repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/jpen/code/). If you want to play and contribute then you can fork, checkout a new branch at the latest release tag (x-xxxxxx) and do pull requests. 

* **Comments and bug reports** are now welcome [here](https://github.com/nicarran/jpen/issues). The [forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/jpen/discussion/753961/) and [ticket system](https://sourceforge.net/p/jpen/_list/tickets) on Sourceforge will be readonly when the migration is complete.

* The [main documentation page](http://jpen.sf.net) is pending to be updated and migrated. This is already work in progress.

Thank you!
